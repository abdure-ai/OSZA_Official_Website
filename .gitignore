# Wait, I shouldn't ignore all .md files, only brain ones.
# Actually brain is usually outside the project root in <appDataDir>, but since I'm agentic I should be careful.
# The user's metadata says c:\laragon\www\Official Website is the workspace.
# The artifacts are in C:\Users\user\.gemini\antigravity\brain\... which is OUTSIDE. So no need to ignore.
